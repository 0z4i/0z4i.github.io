<img width="1334" height="612" alt="all" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/786f8ec3-ccca-426c-974d-7d0c6d24c66d" />

## Image 1

The first thing was identify visual elements, to use it as references in this case:
- Colors red and black
- Bandanna
- Bracelet
- Patch
- Military Vest
- A letter N in the bracelet

<img width="1061" height="724" alt="img-1-1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1b564be7-e6f2-41a4-a5b4-8c6c0b16fcf2" />


Then with the references from above, a reverse image search was performed to find other pictures that share similar elements, there are two relevant news reports that mention the **ENL Guerrilla**.

The first one [new report](https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x99memc) is about the killing of five Colombian soldiers by **ELN Guerrilla group**, on the [other one page](https://www.france24.com/es/am%C3%A9rica-latina/20251216-al-menos-51-hostigamientos-y-13-regiones-afectadas-lo-que-sabemos-del-paro-armado-del-eln-en-colombia) the pictures show members of this group (ENL) wearing similar equipment, same colors in bandanna and bracelets, but it allows to read in these elements the word **ELN**.

<img width="1061" height="724" alt="img-1-2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8d39ae8b-3891-4e8d-bfb8-80757516d171" />

With the previous obtained data in another google search for `ELN Colombia`, an [article](https://www.armyupress.army.mil/Journals/Military-Review/English-Edition-Archives/July-August-2020/Demarest-ELN/) about the Guerrilla Group was found, it describe the history, structure and show the **logo used by the ELN**, this one have red and black colors as the other pictures

<img width="443" height="415" alt="2-1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7c7e2e05-0bc8-4668-94d8-b076dbeb9428" />

But in the image from the challenge the patch with the logo have something of white color around the patch, then a new search for `ELN Guerrilla Logo` was conducted and return a page with a [report about conflicts with the Guerrilla and the Colombian Government](https://zonacero.com/generales/petro-anuncia-acciones-militares-conjuntas-con-venezuela-si-el-eln-no-sale-de-ese-pais) and it have a picture  with **some ELN members**, these people have in the uniform a patch **very similar to the original picture and the found logo**.

With all of this collected information it's possible to infer with a high level of confidence that the picture number 1 about members of the **ENL (Ejercito de Liberacion Nacional) Guerrilla Group.**

<img width="1061" height="724" alt="img-1-3" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/93a037d8-abc8-466d-835b-53e528101174" />

## Image 2

This image shows a woman with a rifle at her back, the rifle have a **yellow circle with a red star inside** This weapon is covered by camouflage, also she wears a camouflage (similar to the rifle) uniform with partially rolled-up sleeves.

<img width="845" height="901" alt="2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/14f07cb8-27da-420e-9751-68419613d674" />


Conducting a image reverse search with google, return two relevant results, the first one is a [anf news post](https://espanol.anf-news.com/mujeres/guerrillera-redur-caminamos-por-la-senda-de-la-martir-zilan-43080) with an interview for a woman called a Jiyan Rêdur member of the **YJA Star guerrilla**, the woman have little similitudes with the woman in the original picture, but have a **camouflaged jacked** that look very similar to the original picture, and the **sleeves are rolled-up** .

Next to this woman there is a weapon cover with camouflage but in this case the circle with the start is not visible.

<img width="1061" height="724" alt="img-2-1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aaec23de-dd42-4951-b3ec-e62e5dc637b5" />


In the other found [anf article](https://hawarnews.com/en/169598448038232), there is a picture with a woman wearing a jacket with a **similar camouflage pattern**, but with other different weapon also covered by camouflage, this post mention the **YJSA Start** group from the **People's Defense Forces** (HPG) and a **Free Women's unit** located un **Kurdistan**.

![9](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7fe7b9d9-9d4d-48d8-bb5e-d01049c95974)

Using the name `Jiyan Rêdur` as search parameter  in Google, a new post from [anf news](https://espanol.anf-news.com/kurdistan/las-hpg-rinden-homenaje-a-los-guerrilleros-newal-merdin-jiyan-redur-y-dijwar-keles-49207) was found, it's about the 3 people death in combat one of them is **Jiyan Rêdur**, in one picture she (Jiyan Rêdur) is in front of a flag with a **green and yellow circle with a red star inside** as the used in the weapon, this page also mention the **HPG**(People's Defense Forces) of Kurdistan.

<img width="1061" height="724" alt="img-2-2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/06c00067-cd6d-4668-a0fa-4e54c45af2d9" />


Now searching for the `HPG Kurdistan` a [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Defence_Forces) mention that the **People's Defense Forces** or **HPG** , is the military wing of the **Kurdistan Workers' Party** (PKK) in the same article there is a [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurdistan_Workers%27_Party) to the Wikipedia page of the Kurdistan Workers' Party and their logo is the same circle with the start.

<img width="1920" height="1280" alt="12" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0618ca03-14e5-4679-9553-55962d8ff584" />


To clarify the information, a search was conducted on `YJA Star Guerrilla`, finding information about the [**Kurdistan Communities Union**](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Shooting-out-of-Love%3A-A-Case-Study-on-Kurdish-in-Redcrow/242544b18b095f0390b68e6c4084a0f87eb20989/figure/14) (KCK), it mention that Kurdistan Workers'Party (PKK) owns the People's Defense Forces (HPG) and it owns the **Free Women's Units - Ishtar** also known as **YJA-START**

All of the above indicates that the woman in the original picture belongs to the group **YJA-START**.

<img width="1094" height="1420" alt="11" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/42aa02fd-8adb-4a62-be34-7db975938b2d" />


## Image 3

This image show a people group in an apparent training session, by the desert landscape is maybe in the **middle east**, the people on the image wear:
- Military Camouflage
- Protection on knees and arms
- Boots
Also they are masked, similar to some Islamic groups, at the background there is a flag with a **white triangle** some text or a draw on black, and the other visible part is black.

<img width="1337" height="783" alt="img-3-1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4343a4dc-6453-43c8-8e48-b3c21e2d3789" />


With this picture in the reverse image search of Yandex, some matches about **ISIS** (Islamic State of Iraq and Syria) but not have matches about the uniform or the flag, this can be an indicator that the image is about an Islamic terrorist group and not just ISIS.

![13](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b56a8ce9-3983-4fd9-bf11-37bb823334ca)


Using the Islamic references it's possible to search in google for the flag by de description as `islamic terrorist groups flags white triangle`, it return a Reddit post titled **Flag of 'Jaish ul-Adl' (Army of Justice), a Jihadist Terrorist Group in Iran**, the post include an image with the mentioned flag, This one has the elements identified in the principal image:
- White triangle
- Black Symbol
- Black frame

![16](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6820f8a4-af28-4f0c-8450-43faa82ae9f0)


With a search on Google for `Jaish ul-Adl flag`, a [publication from Jamestown](https://jamestown.org/jaish-al-adls-reemergence-threatens-iran-pakistan-relations/) this is about the killing of 10 Iranian border guards by militants from **Jaish al-Adl**, the cover of this publication is picture of armed people with two flags at the background with the same elements as the found on reddit post and based on the publication text is the **Jaish ul-Adl Group** and these are their flags.

<img width="1080" height="1080" alt="img-3-3" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8935622d-2264-46f1-8cac-92ddd37f07e8" />

With a group name identified (Jaish ul-Adl), in a Google search for `Jaish ul-Adl training` there is a post from [Afghanistan International](https://www.afintl.com/en/202312180655) from December 18, 2023, it mentioned that the Afghan Taliban is supporting **Jaish ul-Adl** group with bases and logistics there is an image where some people have **highly similar military uniforms**, also wearing the **protection on knees and arms**, **similar boots**.

At the center of the image some body is holding a **flag** and has another behind them, **both have the same elements of the found on reddit**, all of these visual matches point as the possible answer: **Jaish ul-Adl (Army of Justice)**.

<img width="1080" height="1080" alt="img-3-2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/57b0e539-d0ba-4371-9bfd-d73ab25cddf6" />
